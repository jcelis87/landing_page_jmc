# landing_page_jmc
Udacity landing page project

1) The navbar is created dinamically, based in an object in the data file, which simulates an endpoint
2) The others sectios are generated dinamically as well
3) Nav items are underlined as user scrolls and changes the section he/she is looking
4) If user clicks a navbar item the page automatically scrolls to that section
5)If the user scrolls down, the navbar desappears after 3 seconds

The console errors are due to the embeded youtube videos and not the code.
